## What is Neuro SAN?

[**Neuro AI system of agent networks (Neuro SAN)**](https://github.com/cognizant-ai-lab/neuro-san) is an open-source,
data-driven multi-agent orchestration framework designed to simplify and accelerate the development of collaborative AI
systems. It allows users—from machine learning engineers to business domain experts—to quickly build sophisticated
multi-agent applications without extensive coding, using declarative configuration files (in HOCON format).

Neuro SAN enables multiple large language model (LLM)-powered agents to collaboratively solve complex tasks, dynamically
delegating subtasks through adaptive inter-agent communication protocols. This approach addresses the limitations inherent
to single-agent systems, where no single model has all the expertise or context necessary for multifaceted problems.

### ✨ Key Features

* **🗂️ Data-Driven Configuration**: Entire agent networks are defined declaratively via simple HOCON files, empowering
technical and non-technical stakeholders to design agent interactions intuitively.
* **🔀 Adaptive Communication ([AAOSA Protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9812015))**: Agents autonomously determine how
to delegate tasks, making interactions fluid and dynamic with decentralized decision-making.
* **🔒 Sly-Data**: Sly Data facilitates safe handling and transfer of sensitive data between agents without exposing it
directly to any language models.
* **🧩 Dynamic Agent Network Designer**: Includes a meta-agent called the Agent Network Designer – essentially, an agent
that creates other agent networks. Provided as an example with Neuro SAN, it can take a high-level description of a
use-case as input and generate a new custom agent network for it.
* **🛠️ Flexible Tool Integration**: Integrate custom Python-based "coded tools," APIs, databases, and even external
agent ecosystems (Agentforce, Agentspace, CrewAI, MCP, A2A agents, LangChain tools and more) seamlessly into your agent workflows.
* **📈 Robust Traceability**: Detailed logging, tracing, and session-level metrics enhance transparency, debugging, and
operational monitoring.
* **🌐 Extensible and Cloud-Agnostic**: Compatible with a wide variety of LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Ollama,
etc.) and deployable in diverse environments (local machines, containers, or cloud infrastructures).

## Install

These instructions are for Linux and macOS systems. Please adjust the commands accordingly for Windows.

### Install `uv`

[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a fast Python package and project manager built by Astral.

Official installation docs:
👉 [https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

### Create a new Python project

Create a folder for your project:

```bash
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
```

Create a virtual environment, initialize a git repo and install `neuro-san-studio`

```bash
uv init
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv add neuro-san-studio
```

### Initialize neuro-san-studio

Run `ns init` to initialize a Neuro SAN Studio project. `ns` stands for Neuro SAN. You can also use the long command
`neuro-san-studio` instead. It will:
* let you choose an LLM provider
* create a `config` folder with your choice of LLM models and plugins configuration
* create an `mcp` folder with a list of MCP tools
* create a `registries` folder with a simple agent network and the
[Agent Network Designer](#agent-network-designer), so you can start designing your own networks right away
* create `coded_tools` and `middleware` folders with the Python code those agent networks need

To learn more about the `ns` command run `ns --help`.

```bash
ns init
```

```bash
Which LLM providers do you want to enable?

#  Provider       Default model
1  OpenAI         gpt-5.2 (default)
2  Anthropic      claude-sonnet
3  Google Gemini  gemini-3-flash

Enter numbers separated by commas (default: 1):
```

**Note:** To access all Neuro SAN Studio capabilities, clone this repository and follow the setup instructions in the
[docs/dev_guide.md](docs/dev_guide.md).

### Set your LLM API key(s)

1. Set your provider key, e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
(or create a `.env` file in the current directory).
See [docs/api_key.md](docs/api_key.md) for details and other providers.

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="XXX"
   ```

2. Check your LLM API keys are correctly configured:

    ```bash
    ns check-llm-keys
    ```

3. Check your `config/llm_config.hocon` is working:

    ```bash
    ns check-config
    ```

    If the configuration is valid you will get a `hello` response from the configured LLMs.

### Import agent networks

`ns init` already installs the Agent Network Designer, so you can start building right away.
Use `ns import` to add any of the other agent network examples that ship with `neuro-san-studio`.

Run it with no arguments to pick from an interactive list:

```bash
ns import
```

Or name a group or a single network directly:

```bash
ns import basic         # every network in the "basic" group
ns import hello_world   # a single network
```

Each imported network brings its dependencies with it -- coded tools, middleware, sub-networks -- and is registered in
`registries/manifest.hocon`. A running server picks it up within a few seconds.

See [`docs/cli/import.md`](docs/cli/import.md) for the full set of options.

### Start the developer UI

You can start a `neuro-san` server and the `nsflow` UI with the `ns run` command:

```bash
ns run
```

The Neuro SAN server listens on `localhost:8080`.

The nsflow UI is served at
[http://localhost:4173/](http://localhost:4173/).

Logs land under `logs/` (`server.log`, `nsflow.log`, `thinking_dir/`).

Screenshot:

![NSFlow UI Snapshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cognizant-ai-lab/nsflow/main/docs/snapshot01.png)

### Agent Network Designer

Use the Agent Network Designer to create your own agent network.

1. From the `nsflow` UI, click the `NEW` button at the top, center of the screen.
![AND Button](docs/images/agent_network_designer_new_button.png)
2. In the new window that opens, type your prompts in the text box in the bottom right
corner of the screen. Then Agent Network Designer:
   * Creates the agents
   * Links them together
   * Writes instructions for each agent
   * Generates a few sample queries you can ask this agent network
   * Saves the agent network in the `registries/generated` folder
3. Once the Agent Network Designer is done and comes back with an answer in the chat window,
you can continue the design by asking it to make changes
4. Once you're happy with the design, test it! Click the blue `Launch` button at the top
center of the screen. It opens a new window from which you can chat with the agent network.
5. If you want to make modifications, go back to the editor window and ask for changes.
6. You can also edit any agent network by clicking the pen icon next to its name in the main window.

### Import a project from a file / Export to a file

You can import a project from a .hocon file or from a zip file using the `ns import <PATH>`.

```bash
ns import ~/Downloads/my_project.hocon
```

Similarly, you can export an agent network and all its dependencies using the `ns export` command:

```bash
ns export my_project.hocon
```

See [`docs/cli/export.md`](docs/cli/export.md) for details.
