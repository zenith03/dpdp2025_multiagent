        Common handler for progress during the building of agent networks.

        Reports are throttled to at most one per PROGRESS_THROTTLE_SECONDS per
        sly_data instance. A report suppressed by the throttle is not lost for
        good: its reporter is stashed on the ProgressHandler and the latest
        network state is sent by flush_pending() when the agent loop exits
        normally (from AgentNetworkDefinitionMiddleware.aafter_agent()).
        Without that, a build whose last edit lands inside the throttle window
        would leave the client's progress view one or two edits stale.

        Sending is best-effort: a failure inside the send is logged and the
        reporter is re-stashed for the end-of-run flush, so a broken progress
        report can never fail the tool or model call that triggered it.

        :param args: The arguments dictionary for the calling CodedTool.
                Expected to contain a "progress_reporter" entry; without one
                there is nothing to send through and the call is a no-op.
        :param sly_data: The sly_data dictionary on which the throttling state
                (ProgressHandler) is kept.
