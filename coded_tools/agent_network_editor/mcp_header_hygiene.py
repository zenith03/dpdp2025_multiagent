    The headers carry credential material a client controls, so two things

    one header (or one server), never fail a whole request or conversation,
    and no header VALUE may ever reach a log — not directly, and not echoed
    through an exception message.

    One policy, three call sites: usable_header_names decides which names
    count, and URL classification (GetMcpTool.sly_data_http_header_urls),
    the outgoing fetch (sanitized_headers), and the persisted schema
    (AgentNetworkPersistenceMiddleware) all read it, so a generated network

        verbatim in log lines and in persisted sly_data_schema artifacts,
