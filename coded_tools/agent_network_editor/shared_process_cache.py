Generic process-wide, load-once cache for expensive shared values.

This is the one copy of the locking and publish discipline that the Agent
Network Designer family's shared caches were previously each hand-rolling
(ConnectivityDictionaryConverter's ToolboxFactory, GetToolbox's toolbox info,
GetSubnetwork's subnetwork names). Each owning class keeps its public
accessors and clear_*_for_testing API and delegates to an instance of this
class, so all cache *policy* stays visible on the owner while the subtle
*mechanism* lives here once.

class SharedProcessCache(Generic[CachedValue]):
    """
    Process-wide cache of a single expensive value, safe across threads and
    event loops.

    * loader: optional synchronous callable producing the value. It runs
      under the cache lock — and in a worker thread when reached through
      aget() — so it may do blocking file I/O and CPU-heavy parsing. It must
      either return a complete, ready-to-share value or raise; on a raise
      nothing is published, so the next call retries instead of serving a
      half-built or failure value. Loaders must not return None (return an
      empty container instead) — None is the cache's "not loaded" sentinel.
      When the value can only be built from context that exists at the call
      site (e.g. a request-scoped session factory that no standalone loader
      could reach), construct the cache without a loader and fill it through
      aget_or_fill() instead; get() and aget() then raise on a miss.
    * fingerprint: optional cheap callable identifying the version of the
      source the value was built from (e.g. a (path, modification_time) tuple, which can
      also fold in a time bucket for TTL-style expiry). It is captured just
      BEFORE the loader runs and re-checked on every read; when the current
      fingerprint no longer matches the stored one, the entry is treated as a
      miss and reloaded. It must be lock-free-safe and must not raise. When
      None, the value is loaded once and lives for the life of the process.
      stat_modification_time_ns() and time_bucket() below are the standard building
      blocks for composing such fingerprints.

    Concurrency notes (the reasoning previously duplicated per cache):
    * The guard is a threading.Lock rather than an asyncio.Lock because
      callers may run on different event loops in different threads, and an
      asyncio.Lock cannot be shared across event loops.
    * The warm path takes no lock: the entry is a single attribute written
      exactly once per load, only after the loader fully succeeded, and
      CPython reference reads are atomic under the GIL — so a non-None read
      always yields a complete (value, fingerprint) pair. Do not reorder the
      publish in get().
    * aget() keeps the cold load off the event loop via asyncio.to_thread()
      and funnels concurrent cold callers on the same loop into ONE load: the
      first caller creates the load task and the rest await it, so a cold
      burst cannot fill the loop's default executor with lock-waiters. The
      await is shield()-ed, so one cancelled caller cannot cancel the shared
      load out from under the others.
    * aget_or_fill() applies the same discipline to values built by an async
      callable ON the event loop: same once-gate, same capture-fingerprint-
      before-building, same publish-only-on-success. Because a threading.Lock
      cannot be held across an await, its miss double-check is lock-free and
      only the publish takes the lock. The once-gate deduplicates per event
      loop only, and the server hands each concurrent session its own loop —
      so a cold burst can run one fill per session loop. (The loader path
      does not duplicate work this way: get()'s lock makes cross-loop loser
      threads wait and then serve the winner's published entry, while async
      fills have no cross-loop serialization.) A publish-time fingerprint
      re-probe in _fill_and_publish keeps a slower fill whose capture went
      stale from clobbering a fresher racer's entry.
    * A cache is either loader-backed (get()/aget()) or call-site-filled
      (aget_or_fill()), never both; the wrong entry point raises RuntimeError
      on a miss. Beyond keeping each instance's read surface predictable,
      this guards two concrete hazards: an aget() task on a loaderless cache
      would sit doomed in the once-gate slot for an aget_or_fill() caller to
      adopt, and a fill's publish on the event loop would block behind get()
      holding the lock across a whole blocking load in a worker thread.
