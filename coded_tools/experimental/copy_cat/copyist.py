class Copyist(BranchActivation, CodedTool):
    """
    CodedTool implementation of a copyist for the copy_cat reservations example.

    The copyist needs at least a single argument, which is an existing "agent_name",
    reads that hocon file in and makes a temporary agent out of it.

    Optionally, there might be a "call_text" argument. If that is there, then immediately
    invoke the reservation's network with that input.

    The idea is merely to have a proof of concept surrounding the Reservations infrastructure.

    ---

    Upon activation by the agent hierarchy, a CodedTool will have its
    invoke() call called by the system.

    Implementations are expected to clean up after themselves.

        version above when the possibility of making any kind of call that could block
        (like sleep() or a socket read/write out to a web service) is within the
        scope of your CodedTool.

                to the coded tool and whose values are the values passed for them

                but whose values are meant to be kept out of the chat stream.

                This dictionary is largely to be treated as read-only.
                It is possible to add key/value pairs to this dict that do not

                for which coded_tool publishes new entries is well understood

                adding the data is not invoke()-ed more than once.
