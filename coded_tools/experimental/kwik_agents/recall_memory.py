                to the coded tool and whose values are the values passed for them
                by the calling agent.  This dictionary is to be treated as read-only.

                The argument dictionary expects the following keys:
                    "topic" A topic for which to retrieve relevant facts.

                This dictionary is largely to be treated as read-only.
                It is possible to add key/value pairs to this dict that do not
                yet exist as a bulletin board, as long as the responsibility
                for which coded_tool publishes new entries is well understood
                by the agent chain implementation and the coded_tool implementation
                adding the data is not invoke()-ed more than once.
