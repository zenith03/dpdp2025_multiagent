        ProgressHandler's throttle drops (rather than delays) reports arriving within the

        the previous sent report would leave the client's progress view permanently stale
        (issue #1257). Flushing here — when the agent loop exits normally, while the
        request and its journal are still alive — ensures the final network state goes
        out. (If the run aborts on an unhandled error, after-agent hooks are skipped and

        This matters most in the subnetworks (agent_network_editor and pals) and when those

        (the client already receives the tools' own progress reports, so a middleware
        reporter would duplicate that stream). The flush therefore reuses the reporter
        stashed from the throttled tool call instead of needing one of its own.

        reports (see _inject_into_request) clear the pending state on every model call.
