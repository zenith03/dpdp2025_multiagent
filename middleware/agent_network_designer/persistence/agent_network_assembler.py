        Build the sly_data_schema declaring the HTTP headers the assembled
        network's MCP tools need, for placement inside the front man's
        "function" block.

        Generic clients read this schema to learn what private inputs to
        supply outside the chat stream. In particular, nsflow reads
        properties.http_headers.properties to know which MCP server URLs to
        inject stored tokens for (as sly_data["http_headers"][<url>][<header>]),
        and properties.http_headers.required to know which of them must be
        connected before chat is allowed. See registries/tools/you_search.hocon
        for the hand-written reference of this exact shape.

        Only servers whose auth is client-supplied are declared — the ones
        the designing conversation itself provided headers for via sly_data
        (nsflow injects one per connected server). Servers configured in
        mcp_info.hocon are omitted entirely: their auth (if any) lives
        server-side, so a client has nothing to supply for them — matching
        you_search.hocon, which declares only its OAuth server. Every
        declared URL is also in `required`, so clients like nsflow gate
        chat until the user has connected it.

        The header names a server needs are taken from what the conversation
        actually supplied (client_token_mcp_headers[url]), not assumed to be
        "Authorization", so an API-key or other custom-header server is
        described correctly. Only header names are used here — no header
        value ever enters the schema.

        :param network_def: Agent network definition. MCP server URLs are
                recognized as tools-list entries present in
                client_token_mcp_headers — a membership test, never URL pattern
                matching, since tools lists also hold agent names and
                subnetwork references.
        :param client_token_mcp_headers: Mapping of client-token MCP server URL
                to the header names the conversation supplied for it, or None.
                The keys are the URLs whose auth is client-supplied. Names are
                declared verbatim: the producing side supplies stripped, legal,
                deduped names (McpHeaderHygiene.usable_header_names is the
                single owner of that policy), which keeps the schema, the
                fetch, and URL classification telling one story —
                re-normalizing here would just fork the policy.
