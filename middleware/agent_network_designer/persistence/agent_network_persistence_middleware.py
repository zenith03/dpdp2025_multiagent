    Middleware that validates and persists an agent network after the agent finishes
    (i.e., no more tool calls are pending).

    If an agent network definition is present in sly_data, runs structural and instruction
    validators against it. If validation errors are found, a human message containing the
    errors is injected and control jumps back to the model so it can self-correct.

    If no agent network definition is present, this middleware does nothing and returns None,
    allowing the agent to respond freely. This handles cases where loading failed upstream
    (e.g., in AgentNetworkDefinitionMiddleware) and the agent needs to report that error
    rather than produce a network definition.

    Note: Validation is intentionally duplicated here even though individual subnetworks
    already perform their own validation. This is a safeguard for cases where the agent
    returns a final response without having called the necessary tools or subnetworks —
    meaning the subnetwork validators may never have run. By validating in this middleware,
    we catch those premature completions and force the agent to correct itself.
