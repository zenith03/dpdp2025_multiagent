class WebFetch(CodedTool):
    """
    CodedTool implementation that fetches a URL and returns its plain-text body.

    XML and feed responses are returned as extracted text; raw XML markup is not preserved.

    All validation and network access is delegated to the shared SSRF-hardened
    fetch path (SafeFetch): private/loopback/reserved hosts are rejected,
    DNS records are validated at connection time by GlobalOnlyResolver
    (anti DNS-rebinding), redirects are not followed, and response sizes are
    capped. HTML is stripped with BeautifulSoup; PDF bodies are parsed with pypdf.
    Use allowed_domains / blocked_domains for stricter control.

    Error types (raised as ValueError or aiohttp.ClientResponseError or aiohttp.ClientError with the specified message)
        invalid_input            – URL is missing, not a valid http/https URL, or a parameter has an invalid type.
        url_too_long             – URL exceeds the SafeFetch URL length limit.
        url_not_allowed          – URL targets a private/reserved host, is blocked by domain rules,
                                    or returns a redirect.
        url_not_accessible       – HTTP error or network failure while fetching the page.
        too_many_requests        – Server returned HTTP 429.
        unsupported_content_type – Content type is not an approved text, XML, feed, HTML, or PDF type.
        response_too_large       – Content-Length header or streamed body (text or PDF) exceeds the byte limit.
