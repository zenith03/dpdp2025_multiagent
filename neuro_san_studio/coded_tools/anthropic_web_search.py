    A CodedTool implementation for invoking Anthropic web search tool using LangChain's ChatAnthopic.

        :param args: An argument dictionary whose keys are the parameters
                to the coded tool and whose values are the values passed for them
                by the calling agent or user. This dictionary is to be treated as read-only.

                The argument dictionary expects the following keys:
                - from calling agent
                    - "query" (str): Request from the user prompt.
                - from user
                    - "anthropic_model" (str): Anthropic model to call the tool. Default to claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219.
                    - "additional_kwargs" (dict): Any additional arguments for the tool.

        :param sly_data: A dictionary whose keys are defined by the agent hierarchy,
                but whose values are meant to be kept out of the chat stream.

                This dictionary is largely to be treated as read-only.
                It is possible to add key/value pairs to this dict that do not
                yet exist as a bulletin board, as long as the responsibility
                for which coded_tool publishes new entries is well understood
                by the agent chain implementation and the coded_tool implementation
                adding the data is not invoke()-ed more than once.

                Keys expected for this implementation are:
                    None

            In case of successful execution:
