    CodedTool implementation which provides a way to call an agent network.

    async def async_invoke(self, args: Dict[str, Any], sly_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Union[Dict[str, Any], str]:

        :param args: An argument dictionary whose keys are the parameters
                to the coded tool and whose values are the values passed for them
                by the calling agent.  This dictionary is to be treated as read-only.

                The argument dictionary expects the following keys:
                    "tool_args" the arguments for the called agent.
                    "agent_name" the agent that answer the query.
                    "mode" optional mode string passed through to the called agent.
                        An LLM agent following AAOSA must be called with a mode (e.g. "Fulfill"
                        or "Follow up") to return a structured, parseable response;
                        without a mode it replies with user-facing natural-language text.

        :param sly_data: A dictionary whose keys are defined by the agent hierarchy,
                but whose values are meant to be kept out of the chat stream.

                This dictionary is largely to be treated as read-only.
                It is possible to add key/value pairs to this dict that do not
                yet exist as a bulletin board, as long as the responsibility
                for which coded_tool publishes new entries is well understood
                by the agent chain implementation, and the coded_tool implementation
                adding the data is not invoke()-ed more than once.

                Keys expected for this implementation are:
                    "selected_agent" the agent that answer the query

        :return:
            In case of successful execution:
                The answer from the agent as a string.
            otherwise:
                a text string an error message in the format:
                "Error: <error message>"
        """
