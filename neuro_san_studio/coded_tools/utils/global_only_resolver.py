class GlobalOnlyResolver(AbstractResolver):
    """DNS resolver that only returns globally routable addresses.

    Wraps aiohttp's DefaultResolver and requires every resolved address to be
    globally routable (rejects private/loopback/link-local/multicast/reserved
    ranges), raising ValueError with a url_not_allowed prefix otherwise.

    Why a resolver instead of a pre-fetch DNS check: validating a hostname
    *before* the fetch leaves a DNS-rebinding gap. The HTTP client re-resolves
    the hostname at connection time, so an attacker-controlled DNS server can
    return a safe address during validation and an internal one (e.g.
    169.254.169.254) for the actual connection. This resolver runs *inside*
    aiohttp's TCPConnector at connection time, so the addresses validated here
    are exactly the addresses the client connects to — there is no window in
    which the answer can change.

    Usage — disable the connector's DNS cache so every new connection
    re-validates instead of reusing a previously cached answer:

        TCPConnector(resolver=GlobalOnlyResolver(), use_dns_cache=False)

    Limitations:
    - aiohttp's TCPConnector short-circuits IP-literal hosts and never calls
      the resolver for them (see TCPConnector._resolve_host), so IP literals
      must be validated before the fetch (see SafeFetch.validate_hostname_safety,
      which shares ensure_global_address for that check).
    - DNS is not the only rebinding vector: this does not protect requests made
      outside the connector this resolver is attached to.
