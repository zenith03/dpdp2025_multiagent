class SafeFetch:
    """
    Shared SSRF-hardened URL fetching for coded tools that retrieve remote content.

    Currently used by WebFetch; intended for reuse by the RAG tools (webpage RAG,
    PDF RAG) as they migrate onto it.

    SSRF protection blocks private/loopback/reserved ranges and localhost.
    Localhost names and IP literals are rejected up front (validate_hostname_safety);
    other hostnames are validated at connection time by GlobalOnlyResolver, which
    requires every DNS record to be globally routable and closes the DNS-rebinding
    gap. Every network method (get_content_type, fetch_raw, download_pdf_bytes, and
    the fetch_text/fetch_pdf_text wrappers built on them) re-validates the URL at
    entry, so the SSRF policy holds even for a caller that skipped validate_url; all
    requests must still go through a session created by open_session to inherit the
    connection-time resolver check.
    Redirects are not followed; a 3xx response raises url_not_allowed.
    The byte cap (MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES) is enforced both via the Content-Length header
    (pre-check) and on the actual streamed bytes, for text fetches and PDF downloads
    alike, so a server that lies about or omits Content-Length cannot deliver an
    oversized body.

    Error types (raised as ValueError or aiohttp.ClientResponseError or aiohttp.ClientError with the specified message)
        invalid_input            – URL is missing, not a valid http/https URL, or a parameter has an invalid type.
        url_too_long             – URL exceeds MAX_URL_LENGTH characters.
        url_not_allowed          – URL targets a private/reserved host, is blocked by domain rules,
                                    or returns a redirect.
        url_not_accessible       – HTTP error or network failure while fetching the page.
        too_many_requests        – Server returned HTTP 429.
        response_too_large       – Content-Length header or streamed body exceeds MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES.
