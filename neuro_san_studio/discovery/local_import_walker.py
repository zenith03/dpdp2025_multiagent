    """Close a set of ``coded_tools/`` / ``middleware/`` files under their own imports.

    ``DependencyAnalyzer`` maps each HOCON ``class`` field to exactly one module file. That is
    only the entry point: a coded tool routinely imports helper modules that no HOCON ever names
    (``constants.py``, ``and_logger.py``, a persistor factory), and those helpers are just as
    required at runtime. Importing or exporting a network without them lands a tree that raises
    ``ModuleNotFoundError`` the first time the tool is instantiated.

    Following imports statically — rather than copying each entry point's whole containing
    package — keeps the closure precise in both directions. Whole-package copying is too coarse
    (``coded_tools/basic/`` holds tools for a dozen unrelated networks) and too narrow (the
    designer's helpers cross packages: ``coded_tools/agent_network_test_generator/*.py`` all
    import ``coded_tools.agent_network_editor.and_logger``).
