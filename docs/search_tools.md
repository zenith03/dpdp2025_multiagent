## Anthropic Search

Anthropic Search is the built-in web search system used by Claude, designed to let the model access fresh, real-time
information from the internet in a safe, transparent way. It is not a standalone public product (like Google or Bing).
Instead, it is a search layer integrated into Claude, combining multiple web search APIs (E.g., Brave, depending on
partnership and availability).

![Anthropic](./images/Anthropic.png)

_Environment Variables:_

Get an API key by visiting [https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).
Once you have the API key, set it using the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable. The required
langchain-anthropic package is already included with neuro-san-studio.

_Example Usage in Neuro San Studio_:

- [anthropic\_web_search.hocon](../neuro_san_studio/coded_tools/anthropic_web_search.py),
- available as a tool in [toolbox_info.hocon](../neuro_san_studio/toolbox/toolbox_info.hocon)

## Brave Search

Brave Search is an independent, privacy-focused search engine developed by Brave Software, Inc., that uses its own
web index rather than relying on Google or Bing. It does not profile users, meaning it does not collect or store
personal data to track activity.

![Brave](./images/Brave.png)

_Environment Variables:_

To use Brave Search in your agent network, you must obtain an API key from
[https://brave.com/search/api/](https://brave.com/search/api/). Once you have the API key, set it using the
`BRAVE_API_KEY` environment variable.

The Brave search URL is specified via `BRAVE_URL` environment variable. If `BRAVE_URL` is not set, the
default value listed below is used:

[https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search?q=](https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search?q=)

Optionally, you can override the default value by setting `BRAVE_URL` environment variable (E.g., if you're running
a self-hosted Brave Search API clone, or if you want to Switch to a different search engine, like DuckDuckGo). You
can also configure the request timeout (in seconds) using `BRAVE_TIMEOUT`; the default is 30 seconds.

_Example Usage in Neuro San Studio:_

- [brave\_search.hocon](../registries/tools/brave_search.hocon),
- [real\_estate.hocon](../registries/industry/real_estate.hocon),
- available as a tool in [toolbox\_info.hocon](../neuro_san_studio/toolbox/toolbox_info.hocon)

## Dux Distributed Global Search (DDGS)

Dux Distributed Global Search (DDGS) is a Python open-source library that acts as a metasearch tool, aggregating
and ranking search results from multiple web search engines, like Google and Brave, to provide a diverse set of
results. It was originally called duckduckgo\_search but was expanded to support a variety of search backends.

![DDGS](./images/DDGS.png)

DDGS requires no API key, even though it may search Brave or Google. That is because DDGS scrapes public search
result pages and avoids official API endpoints (which require keys). For example, no Google API key needed, because
it does not call

[https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1](https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1)

Instead, it scrapes:

[https://www.google.com/search?q=<query](https://www.google.com/search?q=<query)\>

_Example Usage in Neuro San Studio_:

- [ddgs_search.hocon](../registries/tools/ddgs_search.hocon),
- [agent\_network\_designer.hocon](../registries/agent_network_designer.hocon),
- [agentic\_rag.hocon](../registries/tools/agentic_rag.hocon),
- [airbnb.hocon](../registries/industry/airbnb.hocon),
- [booking.hocon](../registries/industry/booking.hocon),
- [carmax.hocon](../registries/industry/carmax.hocon),
- [expedia.hocon](../registries/industry/expedia.hocon),
- [LinkedInJobSeekerSupportNetwork.hocon](../registries/industry/LinkedInJobSeekerSupportNetwork.hocon),
- available as a tool in [toolbox\_info.hocon](../neuro_san_studio/toolbox/toolbox_info.hocon)

## Google Custom Search Engine

Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) -- now called Programmable Search Engine -- is a service from Google that lets you
create your **own search engine** that searches only **specific sites**, or a controlled slice of the web, with
optional customization and API access. It’s commonly used in websites, apps, and research tools.

![GCSE](./images/GCSE.png)

_Environment Variables_:

To use this search tool, you must

1. Create a Custom Search Engine (CSE)
   - Go to [https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/)
   - Click "Add" → Choose sites or use "\*" to search the whole web
   - Note your Search Engine ID (cx).
2. Get Google API key
   - Go to: [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Enable the Custom Search API.
   - Create an API key under APIs & Services > Credentials.  
3. Use the CSE ID in step 1 to set `GOOGLE_SEARCH_CSE_ID` environment variable.  
4. Use the API key in step 2 to set `GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY` environment variable.
5. You can optionally set a custom search URL and a custom timeout via the `GOOGLE_SEARCH_URL` and
`GOOGLE_SEARCH_TIMEOUT` environment variables. Otherwise, the default values of
[https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1](https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1) and `30` are used.

_Example Usage in Neuro San Studio_:

- [google\_search.hocon](../registries/tools/google_search.hocon),
- available as a tool in [toolbox\_info.hocon](../neuro_san_studio/toolbox/toolbox_info.hocon)

## Google Serper

Google Serper (serper.dev) is a third-party Google Search API service that gives developers programmatic access to
real Google Search results in JSON format. It exists because Google does NOT provide an official full-web Search API,
and scraping Google yourself is difficult, unstable, and often blocked. Serper solves that by doing the scraping on
your behalf and returning clean, structured results.

![Serper](./images/Serper.png)

_Environment Variables:_

To use this search tool, obtain an API key from: [https://serper.dev/](https://serper.dev/). Once you have the API
key, set it using the SERPER\_API\_KEY environment variable.

_Example Usage in Neuro San Studio_:

- Available as a tool in [toolbox\_info.hocon](../neuro_san_studio/toolbox/toolbox_info.hocon)

## OpenAI Search

OpenAI Search is the built-in web search system used by ChatGPT. It is not a standalone search engine like Google/Bing,
nor a public “OpenAI Search API”. It is an internal retrieval system that lets ChatGPT access fresh, real-time
information from the internet when you ask it to “search the web”. It’s not publicly confirmed exactly which
underlying search engine OpenAI uses for all of its web-search features.

_Environment Variables:_

To use this search tool, obtain an API key from:
[https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). Once you have the API key, set it using
the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. The required
langchain-openai package is already included with neuro-san-studio.

_Example Usage in Neuro San Studio:_

- [openai\_web\_search.hocon](../registries/tools/openai_web_search.hocon),
- available as a tool in [toolbox\_info.hocon](../neuro_san_studio/toolbox/toolbox_info.hocon)

## Tavily Search

Tavily Search is a developer-focused search API designed specifically for LLMs, AI agents, and automation. It is
not a traditional search engine like Google or Bing; instead, it is a purpose-built retrieval system optimized for
fast, cheap, reliable, LLM-friendly search. It’s one of the most popular search solutions in the AI ecosystem
(used in LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc.).

![Tavily](./images/Tavily.png)

_Environment Variables:_

To use this search tool, obtain an API key from: [https://www.tavily.com/](https://www.tavily.com/). Once you have
the API key, set it using the TAVILY\_API\_KEY environment variable. You must also have langchain-tavily installed
in your virtual environment.

_Example Usage in Neuro San Studio_:

- Available as a tool in [toolbox\_info.hocon](../neuro_san_studio/toolbox/toolbox_info.hocon)

## You.com Search

You.com is a developer-focused search platform designed for AI agents and automation. It integrates with Neuro SAN
via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), exposing three tools through a single MCP server at `https://api.you.com/mcp`:

- **`you-search`** (Web Search API) — Real-time web and news search with advanced filtering options including site
  filtering, file type restrictions, language filtering, exact term matching, and date ranges. Pricing: $5 per 1,000
  calls.
- **`you-contents`** (Contents API) — Extracts full page content from URLs in Markdown or HTML format, useful for
  documentation analysis and content processing. Pricing: $1 per 1,000 pages.
- **`you-research`** (Research API) — A separate API that provides synthesized, citation-backed answers with
  configurable effort levels: `lite`, `standard`, `deep`, `exhaustive`, and `frontier`. Higher effort levels use more
  sources and deeper reasoning but take longer. Pricing: starting at ~$6.50 per 1,000 calls, varying by effort level.

_Free Tier (No Credentials Required):_

You.com also exposes a free profile of `you-search` that requires no API key. Append `?profile=free` to the MCP
server URL — `https://api.you.com/mcp?profile=free` — to use it without authentication. This profile is limited
to `you-search`; `you-contents` and `you-research` are not available on the free tier.

_Getting a Free API Key:_

1. Go to [https://you.com/platform](https://you.com/platform)
2. Sign up — no credit card required
3. You automatically receive **$100 in free credits** upon signup
4. Get your API key at [https://you.com/platform/api-keys](https://you.com/platform/api-keys)
5. Set it using the `YDC_API_KEY` environment variable

_Getting a Paid API Key:_
