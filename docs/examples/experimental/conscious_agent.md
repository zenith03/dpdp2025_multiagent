# Conscious Agent

The **Conscious Agent** is a basic multi-agent system that is called from the
[conscious_assistant.py](../../../apps/conscious_assistant/conscious_assistant.py) Flask app.

## Note

- Running the flask app will continuously call the agents and can rack up on your token consumption.
- The flask app will store memory items in a file locally. You can turn this feature off by changing the flag in
[list_topics.py](../../../coded_tools/experimental/kwik_agents/list_topics.py)

## File

[conscious_agent.hocon](../../../registries/experimental/conscious_agent.hocon)

---

## Prerequisites

- This agent is **disabled by default**. To test it:
    - Manually enable it in the `manifest.hocon` file.
    - Make sure to install the requirements for this app using the following command:
    `pip install -r apps/conscious_assistant/requirements.txt`
    - run the application with the command:`python -m apps.conscious_assistant.interface_flask

## Description

Once you run the [conscious_assistant.py](../../../apps/conscious_assistant/conscious_assistant.py) Flask app, it will provid
 you with a link, which you can open in your browser to play around with the conscious assistant. This assistant is running
 constantly in the background and "thinking". It may even initiated a dialog. When you chat with it, it will remember facts
 about what you said, and store them in memory, which is saved in a local file.

The hocon file includes an example of calling a coded_tool in a non-default path. This is for the memory operations, for
which the kwik_agents coded tools are reused here.
