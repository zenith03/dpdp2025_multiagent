# Log Analyzer

The **Log Analyzer** is a basic multi-agent system that is called from the [log_analyzer.py](../../../apps/log_analyzer/log_analyzer.py)
app.

**Note**: Running the app will call the agents on all log files and log entries within the files and can rack up on your
token consumption.

## File

[log_analysis_agents.hocon](../../../registries/experimental/log_analysis_agents.hocon)

---

## Prerequisites

- This agent is **disabled by default**. To test it:
    - Manually enable it in the `manifest.hocon` file.
- Run a client with --thinking_dir and interact with an agent network so that the agent logs are stored in `/private/tmp/thinking_dir`
    - For example within neuro-san, call the following:
    `python client.agent_cli --connection direct --agent hello_world --thinking_dir`
- Run the application with the command:`python -m apps.log_analyzer.log_analyzer`

---

## Description

Once you run the [log_analyzer.py](../../../apps/log_analyzer/log_analyzer.py) app, it will review all agent interactions in
all log files located in the directory in the AGENT_THINKING_LOGS_DIRECTORY constant at the top of the python file, and it
will produce a report based on the analysis.

The hocon file includes an example agent network for reviewing the logs. You can point at any agent network hocon in the
registry by modifying the AGENT_NETWORK_NAME constant in the python file. Feel free to modify or extend the given log
analyzer multi-agent hocon. For example, if you'd like to analyze the logs from a different perspective, say security,
you can simply add an agent sub-network as down-chain to the top-agent.
