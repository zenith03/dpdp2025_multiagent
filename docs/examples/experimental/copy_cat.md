# Copy Cat

The **Copy Cat** agent is a small network designed to demonstrate the capabilities of agents creating agents
using Neuro SAN's Reservations API.

## Description

The Copy Cat agent network provides a very simple example as to how an agent
network can create another agent network by use of the Neuro SAN Reservations API.

You give it a network that already exists in the manifest, like "basic/hello_world.hocon"
and it will create a temporary copy of it. Copy Cat will optionally call
the new network depending on the input received.

The new temporary network exists only in memory for the duration that a single server lives.
It has a limited lifespan, as the server will remove it from availablilty after
a prescribed amount of time.  There are no additions to the filesystem, nor any additions
to the manifiest.hocon.  The intent is that this is a clean mechanism for agents to create
other agents that can scale up safely.

By convention, any agent network that creates a temporary network should return a
reference to it via a specific key in the sly_data called "agent_reservations".
The value set for this key is a list of dictionaries describing newly created networks,
which contain information about their names and how long they are available for.
The idea is that if a generic client like nsflow or MAUI can expect this particular key
to have this information in it, then any generic UI can provide new affordances to the
new networks for its users.

Temporary networks names will have a particular format to them.  There is a
human-readable prefix string, which has certain character limitations to it,
and there is a UUID suffix that helps guarantee uniqueness across multiple servers.

## Prerequisites

This agent network requires the following setup:

### Python Dependencies

Nothing special.

### Environment Variables

No special environment variables are required. Temporary network processing is
enabled automatically by the server.

---

## Example Conversation

### Human

```text
Please make a copy of the basic/hello_world.hocon file.

When you are done copying it, call the new agent with the following text:
'From earth, I approach a new planet and wish to send a short 2-word greeting to the new orb.'
```

This is an example of pointing copycat at an existing agent network - hello_world - and then
immediately calling the new temporary agent.

### AI

```text
Hello, world!
```

This is the ideal result from a call to hello_world. We were really calling the temporary
copy of the agent, but it returns us the same results.  As with the existing hello_world agent,
it's only so predictable. Your mileage will vary here.

```json
sly_data: {
    "agent_reservations": [
        {
            "expiration_time": 1659753044,
            "lifetime_in_seconds": 300.0,
            "reservation_id": "copy_cat-hello_world-01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef",
        }
    ]
}
```

The Copy Cat agent creates only a single network, but your own riffs are allowed to create multiple
new temporary networks within a single call. This is why the sly_data agent_reservations value is
a list.  Each element of the list is a dictionary describing a single temporary network each of which
contains the following keys:

* The expiration_time is the UTC time at which the temporary agent will be removed from the server.
* The lifetime_in_seconds is the amount of wall-clock time the temporary agent will remain active.
* The reservation_id is the string name by which the server(s) can refer to the temporary network.
  These names will consist of a human-readable prefix and a UUID suffix for uniqueness.

## Architecture Overview

### Frontman Agent: copy_cat

- Main entry point for user inquiry. Requires at least a valid network name to copy.

- Interprets natural language queries and delegates tasks to the copyist tool.

### Tool: copyist

This agent is a CodedTool that performs the required work of:

1. Checking for network name validity, given the system it is running on.
2. Creating a temporary copy of the target network by reading the hocon file from the filesystem.
   It is worth noting that this copy is not a text copy of the hocon file, but rather the
   resulting dictionary that results from actually reading the hocon file.
   That is, you are not allowed to do any #include or environment variable tricks
   that the hocon parser would normally allow.
3. Creating the temporary network via the ReservationUtil.wait_for_one() helper method.
4. Assmebling the sly_data response per the convention described above.
5. Optionally calling the temporary network with input the front man's parsing of the request
   In order to do this successfully, the CodedTool must derive from both BranchActivation and CodedTool
   to gain access to the use_reservation() method.  This is not strictly required if you are only
   creating new temporary networks and not calling them.

#### Tool Arguments and Parameters

- `agent_name`: The name of the agent to copy

- `call_text`: An optional string to pass as input to the new agent.

#### Tool hocon settings

It is worth calling out that any tool that is going to use the Reservations API
will need to announce that it wants to do so with an allow block in the hocon file:

```
            "allow": {
                # Coded Tools that use the Reservations API specifically need to turn on
                # the "reservations" flag in their own "allow" block in order to get an instance
                # of a Reservationist passed as part of their arguments from the execution environment.
                # This object comes in the "reservationist" key of the args.
                "reservations": True
            }
```

## Debugging Hints

When developing or debugging with OpenAI models, keep the following in mind:

- **API Key Validation**: Ensure your `OPENAI_API_KEY` is valid and has access to preview tools.

- **Rate Limits**: Be aware of API rate limits that may affect LLM calling frequency.

### Common Issues

- **Import Errors**: Ensure langchain-openai is installed

- **Authentication Failures**: Verify API key is set and valid

- **Model Errors**: Confirm the specified GPT model is accessible

- **Agent network .hocon file not found Errors**: Look for typos in your network name you wanted to copy.
  Be sure the .hocon file exists in the filesystem.  If you have copy/pasted this example be sure the
  registries_dir variable in the copyist.py has the correct path_to_basis to your own AGENT_MANIFEST_FILE.
