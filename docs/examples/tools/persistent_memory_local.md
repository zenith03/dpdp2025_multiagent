# Persistent Memory (Local) — file-backed memory

`PersistentMemoryMiddleware` attaches long-term memory to any Neuro-san-studio
agent. Once added to an agent's `middleware` block, the agent retains
important topics and the facts associated with them across sessions. The
middleware injects a preamble into the system prompt that instructs the LLM
on when to invoke the `persistent_memory` tool and what arguments to
provide, and persists every write to disk under a `(network, agent)`
namespace.

This page covers the **file-backed** backends (`json_file` and `markdown_file`),
which write under the project's `memory/` directory. For the cloud-hosted
backend that scopes memories per user, see
[Persistent Memory (Mem0)](persistent_memory_mem0.md).

Writes are per-call: each tool invocation is a self-contained
read-modify-write against disk, guarded by a per-key `asyncio.Lock`. There
is no end-of-turn flush — a crash mid-turn loses at most the call that was
in flight.

## Scope and limitations

This middleware is designed for **local, single-user** usage. Memory is
scoped per `(network, agent)` — not per user. All users sharing the same
agent share the same memory namespace, which means one user can ask the
agent about topics another user stored. This is by design for
single-user local development, but may be surprising in multi-user
deployments. Multi-tenant / per-user memory isolation is out of scope
for this middleware; server-side backends are planned separately.

## Why middleware, not a coded tool

Memory needs two things the agent lifecycle already gives you: a tool the
LLM calls, and a preamble that shapes how the LLM uses it. The tool
description teaches the LLM what the tool does and when to call it (e.g.
"only use when chat context is insufficient"). The preamble adds
behavioral rules the LLM should follow — workflow patterns like "check
memory before answering personal questions", guardrails like "never
fabricate memories", and conventions like "prefer append over create". A
coded tool can register the description but not the preamble, so every
HOCON would have to copy those rules by hand. Middleware ships both
together. See [Middleware](../../user_guide.md#middleware) for the generic
concept.

## Configuration

> **Important:** attach `PersistentMemoryMiddleware` to the `middleware` block
> of **your own agent** — do not import the `persistent_memory_local` agent network
> as a sub-network. The middleware is what registers the tool and injects the
> preamble; calling the reference network from another agent will not give
> that agent memory.

Full configuration with every key shown at its default. Only `class` is
required; every other key is optional and falls back to the value below.

```hocon
"middleware": [
    {
        "class": "middleware.persistent_memory.persistent_memory_middleware.PersistentMemoryMiddleware",  # (required)
        "args": {
            "origin_str": true,                          # framework-injected dotted call path; used to derive the (network, agent) namespace
            "memory_config": {
                "storage": {
                    "backend":     "json_file",     # or "markdown_file"
                    "folder_name": "memory",        # always resolved relative to the repo root
                    "file_name":   "memory"         # json_file backend only
                },
                "summarization": {                       # optional block — omit to leave summarization off (the default)
                    "max_topic_size":  1000,              # 0 disables summarization
                    "model":           "gpt-5.4-mini",
                    "personalization": ""                # appended to the summarizer prompt
                },
                "enabled_operations": ["create", "read", "append", "delete", "search", "list"],
                "preamble": ""                           # optional; override the default memory preamble (see below)
            }
        }
    }
]
```

A complete reference agent using this middleware lives at
[`registries/tools/persistent_memory_local.hocon`](../../../registries/tools/persistent_memory_local.hocon).

## Quick try

The reference network registers a `MemoryAssistant` agent. Start the
server, point your client at it, and have a short conversation with two
people sharing facts:

```text
You:   Hi, I'm Mike. I always order black coffee from Henry's.
Agent: Got it, Mike — I'll remember that.

You:   By the way, my friend Jason only drinks matcha lattes.
Agent: Noted — I'll remember Jason's matcha preference too.
```

Behind the scenes the agent made two calls, one per person:

```text
persistent_memory(operation="create", topic="mike",
                  content="Orders black coffee from Henry's.")
persistent_memory(operation="create", topic="jason",
                  content="Only drinks matcha lattes.")
```

Each person is a separate topic, and every fact about that person lives
under their topic. Restart the server and open a fresh session:

```text
You:   What does Jason drink?
Agent: Jason only drinks matcha lattes.

You:   And what's my usual?
Agent: Your usual is a black coffee from Henry's.
```

The agent reconstructed both facts from disk. What was written depends on
the backend:

**`json_file` backend** — one file per agent, all topics inside it:

```text
./memory/persistent_memory_local/MemoryAssistant/
└── memory.json
```

```json
{
  "mike":  "Orders black coffee from Henry's.",
  "jason": "Only drinks matcha lattes."
}
```

**`markdown_file` backend** — one file per topic:

```text
./memory/persistent_memory_local/MemoryAssistant/
├── mike.md
└── jason.md
```

```markdown
# mike

Orders black coffee from Henry's.
```

```markdown
# jason

Only drinks matcha lattes.
```

## Storage backends

Two backends ship. Both share the same on-disk layout
(`<folder_name>/<network>/<agent>/…`) and the same atomic write (temp-file
rename, so an interrupted write never leaves a torn file).

| Backend         | Layout                      | Lock granularity       | Best for                    |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| `json_file`     | one `memory.json` per agent | per `(network, agent)` | Few topics, many writes     |
| `markdown_file` | one `<topic>.md` per topic  | per topic              | Many topics, hand-editing   |

Either backend works; pick whichever fits your setup. Configure it via
the `storage` block:

```hocon
"storage": {
    "backend":     "json_file",
    "folder_name": "memory",
    "file_name":   "memory"
}
```

The three keys:

- **`backend`** — which store to use. Either `json_file` (one
  `memory.json` per agent) or `markdown_file` (one `.md` file per
  topic). Defaults to `json_file`.
- **`folder_name`** — directory where memory files are written, always
  resolved relative to the repository root. The middleware appends
  `/<network>/<agent>/` beneath it so each agent gets its own slice.
  Defaults to `memory`.
- **`file_name`** — file stem for the JSON backend only; the
  final path is `<folder_name>/<network>/<agent>/<file_name>.json`.
  Ignored by the markdown backend. Defaults to `memory`.

## Summarization

Summarization is **off by default** — minimal wiring will not summarize
anything. To turn it on, add a `summarization` block to `memory_config`.
Once enabled, the summarizer consolidates oversized topics inline, under
the same lock that performed the write, so no concurrent reader ever
observes the oversized intermediate state.

```hocon
"summarization": {
    "max_topic_size":  1000,
    "model":           "gpt-5.4-mini",
    "personalization": "Write summaries in a warm, concise tone."
}
```

The three keys:

- **`max_topic_size`** — character threshold past which a topic is
  summarized. Any write, `read`, or `search` that sees
  `len(content) > max_topic_size` fires the summarizer inline. Set to `0`
  (or omit the whole `summarization` block) to disable summarization
  entirely.
- **`model`** — OpenAI model used to generate the summary. Defaults to
  `gpt-5.4-mini`.
- **`personalization`** — optional string appended to the summarizer
  prompt. A hook for per-deployment tone ("warm and concise", "strictly
  factual", etc.).

`list` returns keys only, so it never triggers the summarizer. Summarizer
failures are caught — the original content stays on disk, so a transient
LLM error cannot destroy memory.

## Restricting operations

All six operations are available by default. Narrow the whitelist to
constrain the LLM:

```hocon
"enabled_operations": ["read", "search", "list"]
```

The JSON-schema `enum` visible to the LLM is narrowed at startup — it
literally cannot pick a disabled operation. Common shapes:

- **Read-only:** `["read", "search", "list"]`
- **Append-only:** `["read", "append", "search", "list"]`
- **Full:** omit the key, or list all six

Unknown entries are dropped with a warning. If *every* entry is unknown
the middleware raises at startup — a loud failure beats a silent "no
tools".

## Customizing the preamble

The preamble is the block of memory instructions the middleware prepends
to the agent's system prompt. It tells the LLM that a `persistent_memory`
tool exists and states the rules for using it: what to store, when to
read vs. write, and conventions like "prefer append over create" or
"never fabricate memories". These rules are what actually drive the model
to call the tool, so they matter as much as the tool itself.

A sensible default ships with the middleware, so you get working behavior
with no configuration. When a network uses memory differently from the
default (for example as a **routing cache** rather than a personal-fact
store), supply your own text via the `preamble` key in `memory_config`
instead of editing the shared default:

```hocon
"preamble": """
You have a 'persistent_memory' tool for facts that must survive across turns and sessions.

Rules:
- Store only generalized routing data (topic, leaf agents, parameter names); NEVER save the user's own values.
- Report only what the tool returns; NEVER fabricate memories.
- Prefer generalizing one memory over creating more.
"""
```

Omit the key (or leave it empty) to keep the built-in default. A blank or
whitespace-only value is treated as "no override". See
[Intranet Agents With Memory Routing](../industry/intranet_agents_with_memory_routing.md)
for a network that overrides the preamble to use memory as a routing cache.

```

Each agent gets its own slice of disk so memories never leak between agents
or networks. The slice is identified by a `(network, agent)` pair — for
example, a `MemoryAssistant` in the `persistent_memory_local` network writes to
`./memory/persistent_memory_local/MemoryAssistant/`.

The middleware figures out this pair automatically from the agent's
runtime call path, which the framework passes in as `origin_str`. Setting
`"origin_str": true` in the middleware args asks the framework to inject
this path; if you forget, the namespace falls back to
`./memory/unknown/unknown/` and you'll see a warning in the logs.

## Reference

Unknown keys in `memory_config` at either level are ignored with a
warning — typos surface quickly without crashing the server.

### Operations

| Operation | Required args      | Returns                                    |
| :-------- | :----------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| `create`  | `topic`, `content` | `{"status": "created", "topic": ...}`      |
| `read`    | `topic`            | `{"topic": ..., "content": ...}`           |
| `append`  | `topic`, `content` | `{"status": "appended", "topic": ...}`     |
| `delete`  | `topic`            | `{"status": "deleted", "topic": ...}`      |
| `search`  | `query`, `limit?`  | `{"results": [{"topic", "content", ...}]}` |
| `list`    | —                  | `{"topics": [...]}`                        |

`create` overwrites. `append` adds a timestamped line. `delete` removes
the entire topic (not a single line). `search` keyword-ranks across this
agent's topics.

### Debugging

- **Inspect on disk.** `<folder_name>/<network>/<agent>/` holds the raw files
  for either backend. Hand-edit them and the next `read` picks up your
  change.
- **"Operation X is not enabled"** — check `enabled_operations` in your
  HOCON. The error message lists exactly what is enabled.
- **Summaries never appear** — either `max_topic_size` is too high for
  your content, the `model` string is wrong, or the summarizer is
  erroring and swallowing the failure. Every summarizer error is logged
  at `WARNING`.
- **`unknown` in filesystem paths** — `origin_str` was empty or
  malformed. In almost every deployment this means `"origin_str": true`
  is missing from the middleware `args`.
