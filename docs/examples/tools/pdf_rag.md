# PDF RAG Assistant

The **PDF RAG Assistant** answers user queries using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) over a set of PDF files.

## File

## Prerequisites

* Install pymupdf package, a high-performance Python library for data extraction, analysis, conversion & manipulation of PDF (and other) documents:

    ```bash
    pip install pymupdf
    ```

## Prerequisites for PostgreSQL Vector Store

* Install Docker: https://www.docker.com/get-started/
* Install Python package:

    ```bash
    pip install langchain-postgres
    ```

* Set environment variables: `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, `POSTGRES_DB`
* Run docker container:

    ```bash
    docker run --name pgvector-container -e POSTGRES_USER=<user> -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password> -e POSTGRES_DB=<db_name> -p 6024:5432 -d pgvector/pgvector:pg16
    ```
    
    This starts and run a PostgreSQL container in the backgroud and maps port 6024 on your machine to port 5432 in the container.

## Example Conversation

### Human

```text
what is the Evaluation Criteria in the rfp?
```

### AI (PDF RAG Assistant)

```text
The evaluation criteria in the RFP are as follows:

    1. Any award made pursuant to this RFP will be based upon the proposal with appropriate information contained in
    the RFP.
    2. Vendors must address all matters raised in the RFP.
    3. Statements made about the performance and specifications of the proposed solution will be considered.
    4. Consideration is given to operational, technical, cost, and management requirements.
    5. Evaluation of offers will be based upon the Vendor’s responsiveness.

These criteria are used to assess the suitability of proposals and ensure they meet the necessary requirements outlined
in the RFP.

## Architecture Overview

### Frontman Agent: **PDF RAG Assistant**

* Entry point for user queries.
* Parses the query and routes it to the appropriate tool (`rag_retriever`).
* Collects and composes responses from tools.

### Tool: `rag_retriever`

* Loads PDFs, builds an in-memory or postgres vector store, and answers questions based on content.
* Useful when information is embedded in static documents.

#### User-Defined Arguments

##### Required

* `urls` (list): List of PDF URLs or file paths to use for RAG.

##### Optional

* `vector_store_type (str)`: `in-memory` or `postgres`. Default to `in_memory`.
* `table_name (str)`: Table name for postgres. If the table exists, create a vector store from
the table instead of documents. Default to `vectorstore`
* `save_vector_store` (bool): Save the vector store to a JSON file. For in-memory vector store only.
* `vector_store_path`(str): Path to save/load the vector store
(absolute or relative to `neuro-san-studio/neuro_san_studio/coded_tools/pdf_rag/`). For in-memory vector store only

    > If `vector_store_path` is defined, the tool attempts to load the specified vector store instead of generating a new one.
At this time, the tool does not support appending additional input to an existing vector store.

## Debugging Hints

Check the following during development or troubleshooting:

* Ensure the **agent** tool is correctly identified as the frontman (no parameters in its function definition).
* Confirm that required arguments (like `query`) are passed correctly.
* Make sure that all URLs are valid.
* Validate vectorstore loading and document parsing for the RAG tool.
* Look at logs to ensure smooth delegation across tool calls and proper response integration.
