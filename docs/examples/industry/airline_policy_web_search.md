# Airline Policy Web Search Assistant

The **Airline Policy Web Search Assistant** is a multi-agent system that answers customer questions about airline
policies by scraping the airline's official webpages at runtime. It requires no coded tools — built entirely using
AAOSA and the toolbox — and covers baggage, fares, seating, loyalty programs, travel requirements, and special
assistance, all grounded strictly in live content retrieved from the airline's own site.

## Description

This network follows a three-tier hierarchical architecture using the [AAOSA](../../user_guide.md) pattern:

1. **Frontman** (`Airline_Policy_Agent`) — the sole interface with the customer. Decomposes queries into sub-questions, routes each to the relevant domain agent, composes a unified answer, and aggregates source URLs.
2. **Domain agents** — eighteen agents, each covering a narrow policy area, that delegate to a RAG leaf tool.
3. **RAG tools** — each domain agent owns a single `webpage_rag` tool that scrapes a specific airline FAQ or policy page at query time.

All answers are strictly grounded in content retrieved from the airline's webpages. External knowledge is never used.
When multiple pages return conflicting information, the system surfaces the conflict to the user rather than silently
resolving it.

## Example Conversation

### Human

```text
On a domestic Economy bundle fare, do I get a free carry-on bag?
```

### AI (Airline_Policy_Agent)

```text
Yes. On an Economy bundle fare, you get a personal item and a carry-on bag included.

### Human

```text
What boarding and seating options are available for families traveling with young children?
```

### AI (Airline_Policy_Agent)

```text
Frontier offers a family seating guarantee for children 13 or younger traveling with an accompanying adult, but boarding options for families with young children are not provided in the retrieved information.

Seating (family seating guarantee):
- Frontier will guarantee adjacent seats for a child or children (13 years of age or younger) and an accompanying adult (over age 13) at no additional cost for all fare types, if all of the following are met:
  - The child (13 or younger) and the accompanying adult (over 13) are on the same reservation.
  - Adjacent seats are available at the time of booking in the selected class of service.
  - The adult either chooses seats for the entire reservation or skips seats for the entire reservation.
  - You must not make changes to seat assignments once seats are assigned.
  - It must be physically possible based on the seat layout to seat the number of children traveling next to the accompanying adult(s).

Boarding:
- The retrieved information does not include any specific boarding options for families traveling with young children (for example, family boarding or pre-boarding), so I can’t confirm what Frontier offers for boarding from the available content.

## Architecture Overview

### Frontman Agent: **Airline_Policy_Agent**

- Acts as the sole interface with the customer — does not expose sub-agents or internal systems.
- Decomposes the customer's query into sub-questions and routes each to the domain agent whose scope best matches.
- Composes a unified answer from all domain agent responses.
- Aggregates all source URLs from the domain agents and lists them under a **Sources:** header at the end of the reply.

## RAG Tools (Leaf Tool Layer)

Each domain agent owns a single `webpage_rag` tool from the toolbox that scrapes a specific airline URL at query time. The
agent answers solely from the retrieved content.

| `Optional_Services_Pricing_RAG` | `flyfrontier.com/optional-services/` |

## Test Fixtures

23 integration tests for this agent network are located in
[tests/fixtures/industry/airline_policy_web_search/](../../../tests/fixtures/industry/airline_policy_web_search/).

---

## Debugging Hints

- **No external knowledge**: Every claim in the answer must trace back to a sub-agent response from a RAG tool.
  If the agent is hallucinating, check whether the tool is actually being called.
- **RAG content gaps**: If a leaf agent says information is unavailable, verify the target URLs are reachable
  and returning expected content. Page structure changes can cause silent content gaps, or a page may have moved to a different URL.
- **Missing sources**: `Airline_Policy_Agent` collects source URLs directly from domain agent responses. If sources
  are missing, verify that the domain agents are including source URLs in their replies and that the frontman's
  instructions to aggregate them are being followed.
- **Timeout**: Each integration test interaction has a 180-second timeout. If tests are timing out, check
  network connectivity to the scraped URLs.
