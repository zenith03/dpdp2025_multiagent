class FailFastParamMixin:
    """
    Mixin that provides fail-fast behavior for parameterized, HOCON-driven E2E tests.

    What it does
    ------------
    - For a single parameterized test *group* (i.e., all cases generated from one base
    test method), if any case fails, all remaining cases in that same group are skipped.
    This avoids cascading failures and saves runtime.

    How it works
    ------------
    - Uses shared per-class state (_fail_fast_flags) so that later parameterized cases
    can observe failures from earlier cases within the same group.
    - Derives a stable "group key" from the base test method name (from unittest's
    generated self._testMethodName created by parameterized.expand).
    - Calls pytest.skip(...) to skip remaining cases after the first failure.

    Important notes
    ---------------
    - This is not a global "stop pytest" feature; it only affects test methods that
    explicitly use this mixin helper (e.g., run_hocon_fail_fast / _fail_fast_skip_if_failed).
    - Designed for unittest.TestCase + parameterized.expand style tests (not pure pytest
    parametrize fixtures).

        Run one HOCON-driven E2E test case with FAIL-FAST behavior for the *parameterized group*.

        This helper is intended for end-to-end (E2E) integration tests where:
        - Each .hocon file represents one full scenario/case.
        - If one scenario fails, running the remaining scenarios is often not useful
            (it usually causes cascading failures and wastes runtime).

        How grouping works:
        - parameterized.expand generates a unique unittest-style method name per case, e.g.
            test_hocon_xxx_e2e_7_some_description
        - We derive the *base* method name by stripping "_<index>_<rest...>"
            so all cases from the same original test method share ONE group key.
        - Once any case in the group fails, remaining cases in that group are skipped.
