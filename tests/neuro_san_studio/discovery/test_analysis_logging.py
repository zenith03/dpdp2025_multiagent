"""Dependency analysis must not spam the console with pyhocon include warnings.

A pip-installed source tree ships no `config/` directory, so nearly every network's
`include "config/llm_config.hocon"` fails to resolve during analysis. That is expected —
the analyzer tolerates unresolved includes by design — but pyhocon logs
"Cannot include file ..." once per parse, which interleaved noise into every
`ns init` / `ns import` run on a pip install.
